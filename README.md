# My Arch (btw) Setup

This is a working set of scripts and what have you designed to get going on i3 Manjaro without too much hassle.
Not there yet but I hope to be able to run 1 install script that gets everything setup, from the common packages
I want to neovim with all the right plugins/config.

## Post Install Issues

This [article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VMware/Install_Arch_Linux_as_a_guest) explains a lot of the common issues
we may run into when running arch as a vm. It specifically helped me fix an issue that was preventing full screen from
working on a 1440p monitor.

Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.
